Eureka as service registry

### Eureka
[Netflix Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) is a RESTful service that is primarily used in the AWS cloud for the purpose of discovery, load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.
[Spring Cloud Netflix](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/docs/current/reference/html/) provides Netflix OSS integrations for Spring Boot apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment and other Spring programming model idioms.
Before registering your service instances, Eureka Server needs to be started.

#### Eureka Server
Eureka server is developed based on Java. It's a web application, that can be built by following [this instruction](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Building-Eureka-Client-and-Server).
Spring Cloud Netflix provides an easier way to run Eureka server as a Spring Boot application.
* add dependency spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
        </dependency>
```
* annotate main class with @EnableEurekaServer
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class EurekaServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
* configure Eureka server in application.yml
```yaml
server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
```
By default, every Eureka server is also a Eureka client and requires (at least one) service URL to locate a peer.
If you do not provide it, the service runs and works, but it fills your logs with a lot of noise about not being able to register with the peer.
You can disable that by setting: `eureka.client.registerWithEureka=false`

Eureka has web page in which can show the registered instances of a service:

You can access it and view the instances: http://localhost:8761

#### Eureka Client
To integrate Eureka Client in microservices, just adding its starter:
```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
        </dependency>
```
And of course, you should still use @EnableDiscoveryClient to annotate the main class.
